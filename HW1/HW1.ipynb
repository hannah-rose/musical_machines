    "#### 1. (one point) Go out on the web and read about the early history of audio recording.

Give one paragraph on what each of these people contributed to audio recording."

    "Despite being mostly deaf, Thomas Edison developed the first method of recording and reproducing sound in August 1877, when he completed his model of the first phonograph. Edison spend may years working as a telegrapher, and while he was working to improve the telegraph transmitter he noticed that the tape moving through the machine sounded like a voice. By using a stylus and a tinfoil cylinder, he was able to record and play back his own voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alexander Graham Bell's work centered around experiments in sound, and his most moteable accomplishment was the design and patent of the first practical telephone. While working on a harmonic telegraph, Bell became fascinated with the idea of transmitting the human voice over wires. On March 10, 1876, he made the first telephone call to his partner, Thomas Watson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville invented the earliest known sound recording device, the phonautograph (Edison's distinction was that the phonograph could also reproduce the recorded sound). A stenographer by trade, he was fascinated by the idea of transcribing vocal sounds with no omissions. He studied drawings of auditory anatomy and sought to mimic the workings of the ear with a mechanical device. On January 26, 1857, he patented the phonautograph, which was able to create visual images of recorded sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valdemar Poulsen was a Danish inventor and engineer who invented the telegraphone, a magnetic recording device that layed the foundation for today's recording industry. He was the first person to sucessfully implement the magnetic recording of sound by using a thin steel wire, which was later replaced by a steel ribon. One advantage of the telegraphone was its ability to record directly from telephone lines."

Now repeatedly lower the frequency of the softer sine wave by 50 Hz. At what frequency does it become really obvious that there are two sine waves?  Now try it the other direction.
